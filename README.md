# **Context-Based Image Caption Generator**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a **context-aware image caption generator** that generates descriptive captions for images while considering additional contextual information. The model is trained on the **Flickr 8K dataset**, which consists of 8,000 images, each accompanied by 5 captions. The goal is to generate captions that are not only relevant to the image but also contextually aware based on provided text input.

## **Dataset**
The **Flickr 8K dataset** is used for training and evaluation. It includes:
- **8,000 images** from various scenarios.
- **5 captions per image**, providing diverse textual descriptions.

## **Steps Followed**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
#### **Image Preprocessing**:
- Extracted image features using several pre-trained models: **ResNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception**.
- Among these, **Xception** performed the best, followed by **ResNet**.
- The extracted features were stored in a structured format for further use.

#### **Text Preprocessing**:
- Processed all captions by:
  - Converting text to lowercase.
  - Removing stopwords.
  - Tokenizing the sentences.
- Created a vocabulary of **8,000 unique words** for training the model.

### **2. Model Architecture**
The model follows an **encoder-decoder architecture** with an additional context layer to generate context-aware captions.

#### **Encoder**:
- The encoder processes two inputs:
  1. **Image Features**: Extracted using a pre-trained CNN (Xception or ResNet).
  2. **Context Text**: Additional textual context provided by the user.
- These inputs are encoded into a unified representation that captures both visual and textual information.

#### **Decoder**:
- The decoder generates the output caption word by word, conditioned on the encoded representation from the encoder.
- It uses a combination of **LSTM** and **Dense layers** to produce a probability distribution over the vocabulary, enabling the generation of context-aware captions.

#### **Context Layer**:
- A dedicated layer is added to incorporate the provided context text into the caption generation process.
- This layer ensures that the generated captions are not only relevant to the image but also aligned with the given context.

## **Key Features**
- **Context-Aware Captioning**: The model generates captions that are tailored to both the image and the provided context.
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Combines visual (image) and textual (context) inputs for enhanced caption generation.
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: Utilizes pre-trained CNNs (Xception, ResNet) for robust feature extraction.

---

## **Results**
- The model successfully generates captions that are both descriptive and contextually relevant.
- Qualitative evaluation shows that the inclusion of context text significantly improves the relevance and accuracy of the generated captions.

---

## **Future Work**
- Incorporate **attention mechanisms** to improve the model's ability to focus on specific regions of the image and context.
- Experiment with larger datasets (e.g., Flickr 30K or MS COCO) for improved generalization.
- Explore advanced architectures like **Transformer-based models** for better performance.
